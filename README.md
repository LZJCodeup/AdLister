# Ad Lister Project

This is a repository for the AdLister Project at Codeup.

This project will help us learn and demonstrate our ability to: 

- Work collaboratively
    - Use git to keep our project synced up
    - Integrate code between individuals
    - Manage deadlines
    - Distribute and delegate work among team members
- Build from scratch a full-stack web application

## Technology Used

We are using the LAMP stack. The application is built with HTML5, CSS with the Bootstrap Framework, JavaScript with Jquery, PHP and mySql.
